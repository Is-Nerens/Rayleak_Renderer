Rayleak is a program that allows you to build simple scenes and render them using path tracing.
This project was built for my final university project.<br>

### Features:
- Scene Navigation
- OBJ model loading
- Material creation
- Direction, point and spotlights

### Limitations:
- Due to tight time constraints the program does not have any scene gizmos which makes object and light manipulation tricky.<br>
- Model files are limited to .obj<br>
- There is no save / load system<br>
- Material settings are limited - no complex BRDF models<br>


### Platform Requirements:
- Windows 10/11
- OpenGL Bindless Texture Support
